# Retinal Scan ML-Based Classifier

This *Retinal Image Scan Classifier Project* seeks to aid in the diagnosis of cataracts, diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma through the use of machine learning - more specifically, this project contrasted three different methodologies and their advantages when it comes to classification.

Three different classifier models were created/implemented in order to analyze their efficiency and accuracy: a nearest-neighbour model, a deep-convolutional neural network, and a pre-existing research-based model.

A thorough analysis of the results can be seen in the project poster and report found [in my website](https://rosedoes.tech/projects#classifier). In addition, the notebook itself can be found on this GitHub repository.
